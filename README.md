# Italian-Vaccination-2020-2023
Analysis of Italy vaccination campaign of covid-19 between December 27, 2020 and March 22, 2023, the italian government got diffenrent types of vaccines to protect the population and two boosters to maintain the protection.  
## Description
This is the continuation of a project developed at the [CRI](https://cri-paris.org/en) Universit√© de Paris in the second semester of the Master of Digital Science( May 2021), within the [Challenge Hub](https://master.cri-paris.org/en/challenge-hub) program.
It is a way of presenting the information regarding what has happened with the vaccination campaign in Italy through the streamlit tool, which allows the user to interact with the information in a friendly and close way.
See the previous [analysis](https://github.com/Eli-2020/Italy_vaccination_campaign).

## Streamlit
[Streamlit-Dashboard](https://eli-2020-italy-vaccination-campaign-italy-ib2dqr.streamlit.app/)
## Discussion
- It remains to be analyzed if the vaccination had problems by region, if the youngest population group that includes minors should have been vaccinated in the first months and instead, the group over 90 years old should have been the priority or if the health personnel had to be vaccinated even faster. One point that is identified with all vaccines is that they have ups and downs in the number of vaccines applied, so determining which days the vaccination rate is lowered would be part of a new analysis.
